Just a Unity project for me to work on in my spare time and to show off my code. Still early on! There's nothing to play yet, but you can look through the code if you like.

Aims with the project:
-Try out test driven development. Create tests for features just before creating the actual feature
-AI. I'm planning on training Unity's ML Agents for the other characters in the game.
-Become more acquainted with Unity's DOTS workflow. The idea is to use the Burst compiler and the job system to improve performance and to do the AI calculations off of the main thread.
